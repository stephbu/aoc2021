# Day 10 Notes
Stack push and peek/pop made light work of 1 and 2. Totally missed the ulong for a second in there for total score in part 2 - especially since the sample data didn't overflow.  Needed to dump out the data verbosely then look at the values, when I noted the negative scores.  Syntax verbosity is definitely a contrafactor in speed racing, and the long silently overflowing yeah that slowed me down by about 5mins :-(. There’s some days you’re the pigeon, and some days you’re the statue.
