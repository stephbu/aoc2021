# Advent of Code

Another year passes and I figured I'd brush off some of the C# cobwebs to get up to speed with some of the neat tools in .NET 6.  I'm running on MacOS, and using VSCode as a lightweight editor.

## Getting started
Should be as simple as cloning this repo, install VSCode, .NET 6.0 Runtime, and the .NET 6.0 SDK.
```
brew install -cask dotnet-sdk
brew install vscode
```

Getting started with code:

```
dotnet build
---
or
---
dotnet run ./bin/debug/net6.0/aoc2021.dll     
```
