# Advent of Code

Another year passes and I figured I'd brush off some of the C# cobwebs to get up to speed with some of the neat tools in .NET 6.  

Unlike many other challenges, the primary goal here isn't clean/maintainable code.  I will get in each day at 9pm, take the challenge, get as many stars as I can, then commit and get out.  I'm aspiring to do all 25 days, and get two stars each day, but it may not happen.

I'm running on MacOS, and using VSCode as a lightweight editor.

## Getting started
Should be as simple as cloning this repo, install VSCode, .NET 6.0 Runtime, and the .NET 6.0 SDK.
```
brew install -cask dotnet-sdk
brew install vscode
```

Getting started with code:

```
dotnet build
---
or
---
dotnet run ./bin/debug/net6.0/aoc2021.dll     
```
