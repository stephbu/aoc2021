# Day 3 Notes
Wow that was the most wordy explaination.  I skipped the bitshifting and did an ugly linear scan for Puzzle 1.  Puzzle 2 I ditched the scan and loaded the input into memory, then recursively culled it while computing most/least common bits. 

Remembered this time to preserve Puzzle1. The goal here was time to solution, and not solution execution speed - do not repeat this in product - you've been warned.
