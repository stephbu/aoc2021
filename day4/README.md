# Day 4 Notes
Late start tonight, after friends-dinner wrapped up.  First time to break out the debugger.  Switched from using IEnumerable<string> to IEnumerator<string> so I could control the 'cursor' point in the file as I loaded data in, first loading the drawn numbers, skipping lines, then switching to loading the boards.  Part 1 'play' logic was fairly straight forwards.  Part 2 got hung up on how to enumerate boards, and modify the board object while mid-loop.  I'll rip off the bandaid and switch back to arrays and indexers next time.  During post-completion cooldown wrote a neat little LINQ extension to find elements in a multidimensional array.
