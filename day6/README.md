# Day 6 Notes
Day 6 pretty straightforward - the problem had an attractive nuisance lure of simulating each fish individually induced by the Day 18 presentation.  To simulate Day 80 for the sample and input data was tractable.  To hit Day 256 would quickly get into an enormous memory scanning problem doubled in magnitude every ~7 days.  Instead I switched to a revolving buffer approach, initially I tried to move the pointer to the "zeroth" day, but had problems with an off-by-one error that I ended up abandoning, switched to a simpler rotation through movement approach that was easier to debug.
