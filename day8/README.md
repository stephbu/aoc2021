# Day 8 Notes
Boy was that ugly.  First the description was (probably deliberately) ambigious.  The test data was even nastier to parse out the intent from.
Eventually got P1 one-line sample going.  Trying the same code against P2 made me realize that I'd missed the encoding being unique for each line.  Complete reorganization ensues.  Mapping backwards/forwards from character extrapolations/segments was relatively simple but intensive this late at night. Was going to write it as bit-wise comparisons, but decided against it after having to make line segments to real segments to values, and trying to debug that once.   Ended up writing simple char-wise XORs, ANDs etc - that made the output pretty easy to read and debug. Eventually got there, not stayed up late to code in ages.
